# Gas_Lift_and_Choke_Optimization

#### Part A: Gas Lift Systems
Purpose: Gas injection reduces hydrostatic pressure, allowing reservoir pressure to push fluids to surface

Key Variables:
* Gas injection rate (too little = insufficient lift, too much = waste + instability)
* Wellhead pressure (back-pressure on system)
* Reservoir pressure (driving force)
* Water cut (affects fluid density)
* Well depth (affects hydrostatic head)
\n  
Optimization: Increasing gas injection, does not always increase oil production. There is an optimal point. Too much gas creates turbulence and can actually reduce flow.

#### Part B: Choke Flow Physics
Purpose: Chokes are production control devices. They can increase or decrease the flow rate and wellhead pressure by changing the orifice diameter.

Key Concepts:
* Critical Flow: When pressure drop is high enough, flow becomes sonic.
* Choke Size: Measured in 64ths of an inch.

Key Variables:

* Upstream/downstream pressure (driving force)
* Fluid properties (density, viscosity)
* Gas-liquid ratio (affects flow patterns)
* Optimization: In the field, engineers often adjust chokes based on intuition. We can use data and ML to find the optimal point and do better.
